This mod herps all the derps in Minecraft chat. Inspired by <http://www.jwz.org/herpderp/> and <http://www.tannr.com/herp-derp-youtube-comments/>

### Usage
Compile or grab a release, drop into `/mods` folder and use the command `/herpderp` in-game to toggle. This does not affect server chat; only you will see the effect. This does not change chat messages you send to the server.

### To-do
* Per-player herp derp
* 1.7.10

### Bugs
* Formatting may be lost within chat messages
