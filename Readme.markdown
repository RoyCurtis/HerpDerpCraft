This mod herps all the derps in Minecraft chat. Inspired by <http://www.jwz.org/herpderp/> and <http://www.tannr.com/herp-derp-youtube-comments/>

### Usage
Compile or [grab a release](https://github.com/RoyCurtis/HerpDerpCraft/releases), drop into `.minecraft/mods` folder and use the command `/herpderp` in-game to toggle. This does not affect server chat; only you will see the effect. This does not change chat messages you send to the server.

To configure, open `HerpDerp.cfg` in the `.minecraft/config` folder.

Whilst enabled, original chat messages are dumped to the log. Make sure your Launcher profile is set to "[Keep the launcher open](http://i.imgur.com/hhXZMuP.png)" to access logging during play.

### To-do
* Per-player herp derp
* Try and backport to 1.7.2 (maybe even 1.6.4?)

### Bugs
* Formatting may be lost within chat messages
* Some servers are not yet supported (special chat format/syntax), but you can try to fix this yourself in the config file
